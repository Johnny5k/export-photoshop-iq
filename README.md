export-photoshop-iq
===================

A Photoshop script to export multiple versions of a single image, in different resolutions and compressions.

Takes an input of jpg or png files, and exports multiple versions, of the same file format. You can set any number of output files and settings in the first array in the script.

This has been tested on Photoshop CC for Mac OSX 10.9.2

To install, add the jsx file to your Photoshop "Scripts" folder (mine's at /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CC/Presets/Scripts). Restart photoshop. Then you can run the script with an open file, or better - create an action that just run the script. Then create a droplet that runs that action. Then you can drop any number of files onto the droplet to automatically export all the copies of all the files at once.
